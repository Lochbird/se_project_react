# WTWR (What to Wear?)

## About my project

What to Wear is a website that'll use an Api to track the weather and give you options for what to wear based on temperature.
This is my first project using React, and so far I just love how simple and thoughtful the functionality is.
It'll take some time getting used to but I think I'll get it down soon enough.
